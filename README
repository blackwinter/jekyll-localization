= jekyll-localization - Jekyll plugin that adds localization features to the rendering engine.

== VERSION

This documentation refers to jekyll-localization version 0.0.3


== DESCRIPTION

Jekyll plugin that adds localization features to the rendering engine.

Add the following to your <tt>_plugins/ext.rb</tt> file:

  require 'jekyll-localization'

Then start using Jekyll::Filters#t in your templates, which will extract
the target language from the file name (<tt><NAME>.<LANG>.<EXT></tt>,
where +LANG+ is supposed to be a two-letter language code). The order
of the arguments corresponds to the order of the languages defined in
Localization::LANGUAGES (e.g., +en+, +de+, +fr+):

  Some <%= t 'translated', 'Ã¼bersetzter' %> text.

You can modify Jekyll::LANGUAGES to add languages or change their order.
The first one is the default language and will be used when a translation
is missing (+fr+ in this example).
